[shapeless-2.2.0][shapeless] is out at last!

For the first time it's available for Scala 2.11.x and 2.10.x for _both_ the JVM and for [Scala.js][scalajs], and with
full support for systems like [Spark][spark] which use Java serialization. Many thanks to Alistair Johnson, Ben
Hutchison, David Barri, Sébastien Doeraene and Adelbert Chang for their assistance with this.

This was originally intended to be a fairly minor, hence rapid, release following on from shapeless-2.1.0, primarily
showcasing support for derivation of type classes for higher-kinded types (see, eg., the example derivation of
`Functor` instances [here][functor]).  However, one thing led to another, and various additions found their way onto
the agenda: porting [shapeless-contrib][shapeless-contrib] to shapeless-2.2.0 turned out to require some changes to
the way that derived orphan type class instances were handled (I'll post an article about this in the near future) and
the increasing interest in Scala.js and Spark made first class support for those two projects a great deal more
urgent.

My "one branch per platform" policy seems to be paying off: managing the differences between Scala 2.11.x and Scala
2.10.x for each of the JVM and Scala.js by branching and merging (as opposed to managing platform variations within a
single branch) is working out very smoothly. It means that releases have to be made from four branches simultaneously,
a chore which Johnny Everson has automated with a [multi-branch release script][release-script] ...
it's been a real time saver.

Many thanks to everyone who contributed ... release notes follow ...

This is the final release of [shapeless-2.2.0][shapeless].  These
release notes provide a summary of changes since shapeless 2.1.0.
shapeless 2.2.0 should be source and binary compatible with shapeless
2.1.0, and for migration from shapeless 2.0.0 the earlier [migration
guide from shapeless 2.0.0 to 2.1.0][migration] is still applicable and
is available on the [shapeless wiki][wiki].

Many thanks to all of you and everyone else who has contributed ideas,
enthusiasm and encouragement.

There are a large number of new features, refactorings and [bug
fixes][fixes] in shapeless 2.2.0. The most significant of these are,

* Scala.js is now officially supported. Many thanks to Alistair Johnson,
  Ben Hutchison, David Barri and Sébastien Doeraene for their assistance
  with this.

* Support for Spark (and other libraries and systems which use Java
  serialization) has been improved by having all the major types and
  type classes extend Serializable.

* Added support for derivation of type classes for higher-kinded types.
  See in particular the new [example][functor] illustrating the
  application of this to the automatic derivation of Functor type class
  instances for ADTs.

* Generic derivation for coproducts now correctly handles cases where
  the type parameters of constructors is a subset and/or permutation of
  the type parameters of the data type. This allows correct type class
  derivation for types like Cat's `Xor` and `Ior`, and Scalaz's
  disjunction.

* Added support for Generic representation of types with repeated
  (ie. vararg) constructor arguments.

* There are now `Generic` instances for ADTs with constructors which
  are included via multiple inheritance paths.

* The test for "case-class-likeness" has been tightened to exclude some
  unexpected types (notably arrays).

* A mechanism providing greater control over the implicit priority of
  derived orphan type class instances has been added. This finally
  allows shapeless-contrib to be updated to use shapeless-2.2.0.

* A mechanism allowing expensive implicit definitions to be cached
  simply has been added.

* `Witness` instances are now available for the singleton types of
  stable values.

* A mechanism to replace Scala's now deprecated auto-tupling has been
  added via the [ProductArgs][prodargs] and SingletonProductArgs traits.
  This supports some [new examples][basecopy] illustrating a generic
  solution to the common problem of functional update of a family of
  case classes through their common supertype.

* A `Max` type class has been added for `Nat` types.

* A `fields` method has been added to records and unions.

* Added a useful toString to instances of the Typeable type class.

* Added a useful toString to Sized containers.

* Improved the CSV serialization example.

* Added an example of [merging][merge] instances of one case class into
  another.

* With the addition of Scala.js support there are now four branches to
  release from simultaneously. Many thanks to Johnny Everson for his
  contribution of a script to automate this process.

* A number of tests have been made more portable so that they don't
  fail when run under Scala.js due to spurious platform-specifics.

* If you are using Scala 2.10.x it is no longer necessary to provide an
  explicit Scala version suffix for your shapeless dependency. You must
  still ensure that you are using Scala version 2.10.2 or greater, with
  Scala 2.10.5 (or switching to 2.11.x) strongly recommended.

* Reorganized the SBT project modules.
  The "shapeless-" prefix has been dropped from all the module names
  and it is now possible to drop into the Scala REPL with shapeless
  on the classpath using just the "console" command.
