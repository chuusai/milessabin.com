Whoops! shapeless-2.2.1 was _supposed_ to be binary compatible with shapeless-2.2.0 but, well ... it wasn't.

<span class="break"></span>

In particular the improvements to `HList` prepend weren't, and this affected people using [Spray][spray]. That's been
fixed in this release, and we've added the [Migration Manager plugin][sbt-mima-plugin] to the build to make it less
likely that things like this will happen in future (thanks to Alexandre Archambault for that).

I'm also delighted to report that thanks to Jason Zaugg we've got a huge improvement in compile times for code that
uses `Generic` with types that have a coproduct representation. For the gory details see the discussion on [this
ticket][ticket-318] but the TL;DR is that projects like [the shapeless-powered spray-json marshaller for
ENSIME][shapeless-spray] are now perfectly feasible --- a large fanout ADT representing a complex protocol now
compiles in less than two minutes, down from somewhere between twenty minutes and forever previously (thanks to Jason
and Sam Halliday).

This is the final release of [shapeless-2.2.2][shapeless].

These release notes provide a summary of changes since shapeless 2.2.1.
shapeless 2.2.2 is source and binary compatible with shapeless 2.2.0+ and
should be binary compatible with shapeless-2.1.0 in most cases.

This is this is a binary compatibility bugfix and compile time performance
release. The changes are,

* Binary compatibility with shapeless-2.2.0, which was accidentally broken in
  shapeless-2.2.1, has been restored. MiMa has been added to the build to make
  this less likely in the future (thanks to Alexandre Archambault).

* Compile time performance of materialization of Generic instances for types
  with Coproduct representations has been significantly improved. Testing in
  the ensime-server project indicates that this gives compile time speedups of
  more than 10x for real world ADTs with a large fanout, making previously
  infeasible ADTs a realistic target for automatic type class derivation
  (thanks to Jason Zaugg and Sam Halliday).

Many thanks to all of you and everyone else who has contributed ideas,
enthusiasm and encouragement.
