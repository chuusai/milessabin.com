A new shapeless release, just in time for Scala Days Amsterdam. This is primarily a maintenance release, but a few
small enhancements found their way in too.

I'm especially grateful to Alexandre Archambault for fixing a macro hygiene bug in `Generic1` that tripped me up
earlier this week. I'd planned to fix it the following day, but woke up to a pull request without even having
mentioned it --- I don't think that there's anything much more rewarding in FOSS than things like this. Thanks
Alexandre.

I'm also delighted with how much less effort releases are now thanks to the automation contributed by Johnny Everson
--- this release following so soon after 2.2.0 is at least partly thanks to that.

Finally, Scala 2.12.0-M1 is now an officially supported release target, and the Travis CI build is now publishing
snapshots for Scala 2.10.x, 2.11.x and 2.12.0-M1 for the JVM and Scala 2.10.x and 2.11.x for Scala.js.

Many thanks to everyone who contributed ... release notes follow ...

This is the final release of [shapeless-2.2.1][shapeless].  These
release notes provide a summary of changes since shapeless 2.2.0.
shapeless 2.2.1 should be source and binary compatible with shapeless
2.1.0+, and for migration from shapeless 2.0.0 the earlier [migration
guide from shapeless 2.0.0 to 2.1.0][migration] is still applicable and
is available on the [shapeless wiki][wiki].

Contributors for shapeless 2.2.1 are,

* Alexandre Archambault ([@alxarchambault](https://twitter.com/alxarchambault))
* Frank S. Thomas ([@fst9000](https://twitter.com/fst9000))
* Peter Schmitz ([@peterschmitz\_](https://twitter.com/peterschmitz_))

Many thanks to all of you and everyone else who has contributed ideas,
enthusiasm and encouragement.

This is primarily a bugfix release. The most significant changes are,

* Fixed a macro hygiene bug in Generic1 (thanks to Alexandre
  Archambault)

* Several fixes and improvements in HList and Coproduct rotations
  (thanks to Alexandre Archambault).

* Added a prepend operation for Coproducts. Prepend of an HList to HNil
  no longer rebuilds the entire HList (thanks to Alexandre Archambault).

* Added a method to transform the value at the focus of a Zipper (thanks
  to Peter Schmitz)

* Added an example illustrating the use of a coproduct Generic
  representation of an ADT to model a safe enumeration.

* shapeless is now cross built for Scala 2.12.0-M1.

* Snapshot builds are now published for Scala.js by Travis CI

* shapeless in now built with SBT 0.13.8.

shapeless is an exploration of type class and dependent type based generic
programming in Scala.
