I've been selected (against some really excellent competition --- it's a shame more talks couldn't be squeezed in) to
talk at this year's [Northeast Scala Symposium][nescala] in Boston. Thanks to everyone who voted for my [talk][talk]
about [shapeless][shapeless]. <span class="break"></span> It looks like it's going to be a wonderful event, and I'm
really looking forward to meeting up with everyone there.

In advance of that, I'd also be keen to talk to any Scala-using organizations who would be interested in a two/three
day [Advanced Scala training course][training] on the East coast in the run up to, or just after the event --- in
depth coverage of the techniques involved in the creation of shapeless, and how they can be applied elsewhere, will be
included. Please [get in touch][contact] if you're interested.
